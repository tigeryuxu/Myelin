# **Welcome to the nanofiber myelin-quant project**


## Description:
  The aim of this project was to develop an analytic algorithms that are capable of quantifying oligodendrocyte ensheathment at a high-throughput level in nanofiber cultures. The manuscript can be found here: [https://doi.org/10.1101/389932](https://doi.org/10.1101/389932)
